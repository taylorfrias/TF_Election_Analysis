## Challenge Summary
  This was a difficult challege, expectially because of how detail oriented you have to be when it comes to writing code. It took me longer than expected to get through each section of the module. I took the most time in the first half of the modules trying to learn and understand the code I was writing. When working through the rest of the modules I took my time to understand what each step was consisting of, in hopes that it will build a nice foundation for the duration of Python. I wasn't able to get the Largest County turnout, which gave me a lot of difficulties. When trying to have a tutor help me with the process I experienced technical dificulties which made my assignment late.
